# Blockfall

This is a simple game about collecting blue falling blocks and avoiding
dangerous red blocks.

My goal for creating this game was to give myself a project to both test
and grow my abilities as a programmer. I don't know what it is about
making games, but I, along with clearly so many others, feel naturally
inclined to putting pixels on the screen and making them interact. This
project has given me loads of intrinsic motivation to learn more and hone
this craft.

I wrote this in Python using the PyGame module to be as rookie-friendly as
possible to myself. One day I plan on graduating to some other languages,
ideally something compiled so that I can properly share it, but that's for
another day. PyGame may be the most common thing to think of when talking
about creating your first game, but you have to start somewhere.

Because this is a Python project, you'll have to have downloaded Python on
your computer from the [Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/).
I'll work on learning how to make a virtual environment to run it, but
that's currently beyond me.

Once you boot up the game, the only controls so far are the up and down
arrow keys to move the select cursor, the spacebar to select an option or
respawn, and the left or right arrow keys to move your block once in the
game.

I followed a wonderfully made (and lengthy) tutorial on YouTube posted by
Clear Code. Here's the link if you want to check it out:
